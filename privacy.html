		<li>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</li> 
		  	<ul> 
			  <li>MySportsFolio, LLC. as well as certain third parties that provide content and other functionality on the Services—may use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Services and the Internet. This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.</li> 
				<ul> 
			  <li>• Cookies: Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. For example, cookies can be used to store your sign-in credentials so that you do not have to enter them each time you return to a website. Cookies also may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer so that a website can recognize you as the same user across different visits to the website. You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.</li> 
			  </ul>
			</ul>
		<li>MySportsFolio, LLC. and the third parties that provide content or functionality on the Services may use cookies to:</li> 
		  	<ul> 
			  	<li>Collect information about your browsing activities in order to provide you with more relevant content; and</li> 
				<li>Relate the information automatically collected when you use the Services to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources.</li> 
				<li>Other local storage. We, along with third-party partners, may use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. These objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies, however. Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.</li> 
				<li>Web beacons. We, along with our third-party partners, may also use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use Web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</li> 
			</ul>
		<li>Do Not Track Signal</li> 
		  	<ul> 
			  <li>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. We do not currently take action in response to those signals. If an industry standard on responding to such signals is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to those signals.</li> 
			</ul>
		<li>Links to Other Websites</li> 
		  	<ul> 
			  <li>Our Services may contain links or references to third-party owned and/or operated websites that we believe might be of interest to users, including websites of our partners, sponsors, advertisers, and affiliates. We do not control the content of these third-party websites. These third-party websites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. Once you have clicked on a link to a third-party website and leave our Services, you must read the privacy policy of the third-party website to see how your personal information will be handled.</li> 
			</ul>
		<li>Changes to this Privacy Policy</li> 
		  	<ul>
